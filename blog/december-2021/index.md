Happy belated New Year! I skipped November's update because I added a bunch of [book reviews](reading/index.html) to this site.

2021 was great. I gave a killer speech as best man at a wedding, I worked at three different companies ([1](https://www.setsail.co/), [2](https://www.ladderlife.com/), [3](https://robinhood.com/)), I did [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), I took three courses at [Bradfield](https://bradfieldcs.com/), I was admitted to and started the [Bradfield CSI](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/), I [read more](https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/tree/master/2021) than I have since I was a child, and I [wrote more](blog/index.html) in public than I ever have.

#### Site updates

I made a few updates to this site in the past two months. First, like I mentioned above, I added more than a dozen [book reviews](reading/index.html). I'm still working through my backlog. I also updated this site's [home page](index.html), and there's now a section for popular posts. Finally, after a reader request, I added [RSS](rss.xml) support.

#### Reading

I read _The Poverty of Historicism_ by Karl Popper in November. It was an odd book because it's so clearly of its time, making an impassioned argument in a dead debate I never knew existed. But there are gems in it, little pieces of common sense wisdom. I'll write about it more in the future, but for now you can read my [personal notes](https://github.com/iechevarria/reading-notes/blob/master/2021/the-poverty-of-historicism-popper-1957.md).

_Slaughterhouse-Five_ lived up to its reputation. It was very good.

I read a New Yorker article, [A Ghost in the Family](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/a-ghost-in-the-family), about artists Clare Rojas, Margaret Kilgallen, and Barry McGee after seeing a piece by Rojas in SFO. What a strange story.

Jeff Vogel of [Spiderweb Software](https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/) wrote [a piece about video game stories](https://bottomfeeder.substack.com/p/six-truths-about-video-game-stories). Basically, narratives in games are typically terrible, and it doesn't take much to stand out. If you like this post, you might also enjoy his memorable GDC talk, [Failing to Fail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxVBJem3Rs).

#### Watching

I got an HBO Max subscription for just this month to watch _The Matrix Resurrections_. It's a big mess that mostly makes fun of itself and Warner Brothers (by name) for existing. What a novelty it is to see so much money get lit on fire. I ended up watching _The Matrix_ (1999) again, and I like it more every time I see it.

#### Playing

I played the _Halo Infinite_ campaign the day it came out. [I'm a big Halo fan](blog/october-2020/index.html). This one was ... pretty alright! It still has some of the problems that _Halo 4_ and _Halo 5_ did: tedious indoor combat and way too many buttons that need to be pressed. I'm thinking about doing a supercut of all the stupid buttons _Halo Infinite_. But the open world is great, and the sandbox is super fun. I hope we'll see some updates to the single player that extend the open world and add new biomes like desert and jungle.
