In 2017, I made _Some Semblance of Clarity_, a zine, for a photography class. I made this zine probably around the height of my interest in the intersection of art and technology. I still like each but prefer them mostly separate now.

The zine consists of [Dag Hammarskjöld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld)'s poem "August 24, 1961" thrown through Google Translate several times as well as 7 photographs with [Inception v3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inceptionv3)'s top 5 classes for those images. I made 25 copies, put them in a box, and forgot about them until this week.

I'm not going to pretend it's great work, but I do think it's somewhat interesting inasmuch the zine's main concern – the difficulty of identifying / maintaining / representing arbitrary meaning using computers – has largely been solved with LLMs. There are also a few flourishes in the zine's construction like carefully aligned text, some translucent pages, and bits that are handwritten.

Send me an email or Instagram / Twitter DM or whatever else with your address, and I'll mail you a copy. I'll also send a few small prints I made around the same time.
