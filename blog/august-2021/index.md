The last two months were a bit of a whirlwind. First, I left my job, the one I joined only a few months earlier. Not a good look for me! But I’m confident it was the right decision. My long-term goals changed recently, and my work didn’t align with them.

Aside from off-boarding and trying to figure out what I want to do with myself, I spent a solid portion of July and August in [Bradfield](https://bradfieldcs.com/)’s computer networking course. It was – as all Bradfield classes are – great!

In August, I started the Bradfield [Computer Science Intensive](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/), a year-long program. So far, I’ve been brushing up on C, learning Go, and getting better at using the Unix shell.

#### Listening

This episode of [On the Metal](https://oxide.computer/podcasts/kenneth-finnegan) with Kenneth Finnegan was just fantastic. This story of a one-man [autonomous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)) helped me understand so much of the material and political realities of the internet. And it was so much fun!

I also listened to a lot of [Mansur Brown](https://mansurbrown.bandcamp.com/)’s music this month.

#### Reading

I finally finished [Trading at the Speed of Light](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691211381/trading-at-the-speed-of-light) in August, and I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who’s interested in how and why financial markets function as they do. In the next month or two, I think I’ll likely read [An Engine, Not a Camera](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/engine-not-camera), another book by the same author.

[Nadia Eghbal](https://nadiaeghbal.com/) wrote [an article about Arizona State University](https://nadiaeghbal.com/asu), which prioritized access (de-emphasized selectiveness) while also improving its reputation.

Dan Luu’s [post about the importance of measurement](https://danluu.com/why-benchmark/) was great. Some previous work with metrics (total epistemological nightmare) turned me into an enormous data skeptic, which I think was an overcorrection. This article helped me remember that yes, metrics _can_ be meaningful and useful as long as you choose the right ones.

This [post by Adam Tooze](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-34-how-we-paid-for-the) makes the point that the money spent on the War on Terror didn’t actually crowd out or prevent social spending – it’s just that social spending wasn’t a priority. I will never give up a chance to bang on this drum.

#### Writing

I hit the front page of Hacker News for the first time ([thread link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28418105))! It’s funny because the post, [Flowers make a nice gift](https://www.echevarria.io/blog/flowers-make-a-nice-gift/index.html), is easily the least time-intensive one on this site. I’m glad it resonated with people, though! I had a genuinely great time reading all the comments in the thread.

My favorite is [this one](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28418999): “Was this some kind of HN ranking hack or are we really this lacking in news today? Or perhaps so socially stunted as a group that we need this sort of thing pointed out? Wait, maybe don’t answer that.”
