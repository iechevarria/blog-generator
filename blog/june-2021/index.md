I spent June in Virginia visiting my family for the first time in 18 months. I showed up right as the Brood X cicadas were getting into full swing and left after they were nearly all gone.

I made a brief trip down to Richmond, which is maybe my favorite city, and I was shocked to see how much it was changing – mostly for the better it seems. There is construction everywhere. Lots that had been empty or occupied by vacant low-rise industrial buildings are being turned into housing. The San Francisco Bay Area feels stagnant in comparison.

#### Reading

I’ve been slowly making my way through [Trading at the Speed of Light](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691211381/trading-at-the-speed-of-light) by sociologist [Donald MacKenzie](https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/donald-mackenzie). It’s about high frequency trading (HFT), and so far it’s been great. MacKenzie lays out all the strange political decisions that have caused HFT to develop as it has – reliant on a connection between Chicago and New York – and the technology that moves information between these cities at almost the speed of light.

This post, [Seven things that surprised us in our first year working in policy](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ErKzbKWnQMwvzRX4m/seven-things-that-surprised-us-in-our-first-year-working-in)  from the [Lead Exposure Elimination Project (LEEP)](https://leadelimination.org/) was excellent, and I contributed after reading it.

[The Legion Lonely](https://hazlitt.net/longreads/legion-lonely) is a total bummer of an article about men and loneliness, and it’s very good.

[Phenomenal World](https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/wage-share) had [a solid piece](https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/wage-share) about how the wage share of income dropped for 50 years and how that relates to the Fed’s view of labor.

#### Listening

June wasn’t a big music month for me, but I came across this song off [Samuel Organ](https://samuelorgan.bandcamp.com/)’s new album and listened to it a lot.

I’ve been listening to the [Brady Heywood Podcast](https://www.bradyheywood.com.au/podcasts/), a podcast about engineering disasters (it’s [not the only one on engineering disasters](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPxHg4192hLDpTI2w7F9rPg) I listen to). I particularly liked this brief episode about the Tacoma Narrows Bridge that discusses how engineering as a profession lost knowledge it had decades earlier:
