This update is a few days late, but for good reason! I've been in in Three Rivers, California and in Sequoia National Park, home to some of the largest individual trees on the planet.

#### Reading

[Portfolio Society](https://www.zonebooks.org/books/14-portfolio-society-on-the-capitalist-mode-of-prediction) was, surprisingly, a decent introduction to both finance and Marx. It’s quite readable, and it’s endearingly goofy - there’s a half page in the endnotes that imagines characters in The Lion King worrying about saving for their child’s college education.

[Skin in the Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_Game_(book)) was fine. Some things I agreed with, some I didn't, but I wasn't convinced much either way. I do think that Taleb's explicit emphasis on ethics should be praised. Branko Milanovic talks about this in further detail in his [piece about Taleb's system](http://glineq.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-importance-of-talebs-system-from.html) and how it goes "from empirics to ethics."

Another month, another book about Minsky. [Why Minsky Matters](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/why-minsky-matters-an-introduction-to-the-work-of-a-maverick-economist) is an accessible survey of Minsky's work, and it's great. I also read an article, [The Minsky Millennium](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/11/the-minsky-millennium), that looks more closely at Minksy's politics. I'd recommend them both.

I read [The Stranger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(Camus_novel)) in one evening. It's been years since I've read a novel, and I had almost forgotten what it was like to be pulled into fiction.

[Deschooling Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschooling_Society) is about why the institution of school is bad. This book rules. It's also terribly naive, and the author places a great deal of faith in markets, networks, individuals - basically everything that's not school. Still, I'm going to be thinking about this book for a long time. Ivan Illich threw a lot at the wall, but what did stick really stuck.

[The Kid Detective](https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thekiddetective) is a dark-ish comedy that's better than it has any right to be.

I went in pretty blind to [The Killing of a Sacred Deer](https://a24films.com/films/killing-of-a-sacred-deer) and liked it a lot. I particularly enjoyed all the actors' formal, mannered delivery which gave the film the feeling of being a stage play. I'd recommend avoiding the trailer if you intend on watching the movie.


#### Programming

I'm now two and half weeks into Recurse Center, and I've spent most of my time thus far working through [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). It's been a joy to read, and I can't recommend the book strongly enough. I just finished [my implementation](https://github.com/iechevarria/pylox) of a tree-walk interpreter in Python.
