For me, May was the first month resembling normality since COVID started. It was also pretty busy, but in a fun way! I finished [Bradfield](https://bradfieldcs.com/)’s operating systems course, went to a close friend’s wedding, and took a flight to Virginia to visit my family for the first time in 18 months. I feel lucky.

#### Reading

I didn’t read any books in May. Maybe this month!

I did read two particularly good articles about inflation. Alex Williams wrote [a piece about inflation measures](https://vebaccount.substack.com/p/inflation-oren-cass-and-jacques-derrida) and why arguing about which inflation measure is “correct” is a useless exercise. Instead, people should “go out and dig into the detail tables in the inflation data, and make their own trackers.” Matthew C. Klein wrote [an article about the disparity between rents and home prices](https://www.barrons.com/articles/house-prices-are-soaring-rents-are-flat-what-does-it-mean-for-inflation-51621525998), and I really liked how Minsky-ian he sounded when he emphasized that home prices are determined in large part by financing conditions.

I spent part of a weekend reading about the [Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_Image_Recovery_Project), a project to digitize and restore images taken by the Lunar Orbiter program spacecraft in 1966 and 1967. The project operated out of a vacant McDonald’s, and I got a kick out of the images of the workspace. This [Wired article about the LOIRP](https://www.wired.com/2014/04/lost-lunar-photos-recovered-by-great-feats-of-hackerdom-developed-at-a-mcdonalds/) gets the vibe of the project across.

Caleb Gamman's videos are criminally underappreciated – he's been making great and high effort videos for a year now, but they haven't gotten a ton of views. Hopefully the YouTube algorithm will bless him. This is his final entry in his series where he fixes Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. I don't even like Revenge of the Sith, but I still got invested in this project! Gamman also posted his [full list of changes](https://www.calebgamman.com/fixingrevengeofthesith/) if videos aren't your thing.
