When I was younger, I didn’t understand giving flowers as a gift. Flowers don’t last very long – wouldn’t it be better to get a gift that lasts a lifetime? It seemed wasteful to me.

But now I appreciate flowers. Flowers don’t take any effort on your part to be enjoyed. You don’t have to use them, or read them, or find a permanent place on a shelf or in a drawer for them. Flowers never sit unused in a cardboard box that you packed two moves ago. And when you open that box by chance, there aren’t any fraught decisions about whether or not to keep them.

Flowers come without any obligations. They come into your home, and they bring beauty for a time, and then they’re gone. And that’s nice.
