Subprime Attention Crisis was an enormously frustrating book. It made me pretty mad. Every few weeks, I'd go back to thinking about how wrong the book is, and I'd inevitably start telling my girlfriend about it. She said I need to write this down to exorcise it from my mind.

Media is not tech!

TODO: add brief summary here

#### Advertising isn't finance

If you're going to compare something to the subprime mortgage crisis, and the subprime mortgage crisis alone (that is, not to the Great Recession), you need to say so. Hwang does not.

Finance is different. If you're doing anything in a modern market economy, you're exposed to the financial system's operations. If things are going badly for banks, they're probably going badly for you.

A better investigation would actually follow advertising cash flows instead of just supposing that if they drop, bad things will happen. To actually argue that advertising poses systemic risks, you need to lay out the businesses that are dependent on ad revenues either directly or indirectly. But I think this would likely undermine Hwang's point - I would guess that ad-dependence is more localized than.

A single asset class being overvalued does not typically cause a massive systemic c

Ad markets are clearly not too big to fail.

"Like the banks during the subprime mortgage crisis, dense links between advertising-driven businesses and the rest of the economy mean that vulnerability in the attention marketplace may produce harm in other, less expected places." Hwang then goes on to descibe only Google products.

#### Ads aren't mortgage-backed securities

The central comparison in the book is deeply flawed. Ads and mortgage-backed securities are simply not comparable. Let's look at the two more closely:

Mortgage-backed securities: you pay a lot of money up front for an instrument that you're going to hold for decades. You're looking for reliable cash flows for a long duration. In case that you encounter a need for a lot of cash, you want the ability to sell the instrument without taking a loss, so you have an interest in keeping the price of mortgage-backed securities high. You really want the cash flows to be consistent - if they stop (as they did in the subprime mortgage crisis), you're either stuck with an extraordinarily expensive dud on your balance sheet, or you're going to have to sell and take a massive haircut.

Ads: you pay a bit of money to display your ads in the near future. You hope that they increase your cash flows though an increase in sales. Unlike with an MBS, if you're not seeing the cash flows you want, *you can simply stop buying ads*. You are not buying and holding 30-year blocks of ads, and it is counter to your interests for ads to be expensive.


#### More bad economics

The 

The book relies heavily on a notion of "real" or "fundamental" value behind assets which Hwang doesn't define until the last few pages.

Hwang writes that "[when] a hot, overpriced commodity is discovered to be effectively worthless, panic can set in, causing the market to implode." This is a tautology! The discovery that a commodity is "effectively worthless" is itself the market implosion.

"In financial parliance, both CDOs and online advertising inventory are derivatives - they derive their value from an underlying asset. CDOs draw their value from the mortgages they contain; online ad inventory draws its value from the attention that it represents." This is dead wrong. Hwang, only two chapters earlier, explained quite well how advertising inventory is a _commodity_. This is like saying that commodity corn is a derivative because it's abstracted from from the actual kernels. And this is all the more onerous because actual ad derivatives markets are [starting to crop up](https://www.admonsters.com/parsec-afox-smart-contracts-advertising-futures/).

Oh, and the economists Hwang cites most are the rightly disgraced Reinhart and Rogoff. Sad!

#### Opacity

Hwang relies heavily on the concept of opacity in markets to argue that people are paying too much for ads.

In advertising, there are many slips between the cup and the lip - that is, there are a lot of ways for ads to fail. Some of the possibilities: the product is bad, the ad is bad, the targeting is bad

#### It's not going to happen

Hwang admits that advertising has never been as transparent as it is today.

Hwang says that 

Ads have been a very steady 1.5% of GDP for the past 80 years. It's just that now most of these ads are served on the internet - coincidentally, the place where people spend most of their time.

#### Some bright spots

Okay, so do I have anything good to say about the book? Yeah, I do. The second chapter lays out the process of commodification quite well.

The best part of the book is the last chaper. Hwang makes great points about how advertising homogenizes the experience of being on the internet: "Publishers want to streamline sales by providing a simple menu of attention inventory to buy. This requires that online platforms be actively architected in a way that standardizes user engagement and attention." There's a much broader potential range of expression on the internet that the

#### A more likely crisis

I do think tech is vulnerable to another crisis, though its origin would almost certainly been in finance and not in advertising. In the past few years, and especially in the past year or so, valuations have been getting ... let's just say a little stupid. Or maybe not, I don't know, maybe market caps that are 30x revenue are the new normal.

#### Better work on this topic

Read *[The new dot com bubble is here: it's called online advertising](https://thecorrespondent.com/100/the-new-dot-com-bubble-is-here-its-called-online-advertising/13228924500-22d5fd24)* instead.

If the ads don't work or aren't worth the price, what's stopping businesses from simply not buying ads? Hwang never talks about

Advertisers do their best advertising in internally, convincing organizations that they need a marketing budget.

I'm pretty confident I've seen advertising work, though, so this is more a question of how much marginal benefit there is.
