This book feels like it was written for me. I work with computers for a living, I think about the philosophy of science in my free time, I'm Catholic and went to Catholic schools, I spent a lot of my adolescence engaging with post-apocalyptic media â€“ I was going to either love or hate this book. I loved it. I could not put it down. There was a point where I thought I had been reading for only 5 minutes but 30 had passed. I haven't had that kind of experience with a book since I was a kid.

I don't want to say more about it. I went in blind, and I think that's the way other readers ought to.
