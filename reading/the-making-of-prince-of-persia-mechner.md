I read *The Making of Prince of Persia* after [Oz recommended it](https://twitter.com/oznova_/status/1674172555937337344). I have no special fondness for *Prince of Persia*; I've never played it, and I don't intend to now. But I like making-of stories and have heard this one is inspiring.

The journals are an unvarnished window into Mechner's creative process – there are long stretches where he doesn't work on *Prince of Persia* at all, where he does other things that are more interesting to him, like writing screenplays. And they're honest in other, cringe-worthy ways. I admire Mechner's decision to include it all. Some passages I would never put into writing, much less publish for a public audience.

I took note of Mechner's relationship with money – while making *Prince of Persia*, money seemed purely a means to an end for him: he spent freely on hardware and seemed to really only want to make enough to pay his way through film school. He was nearly broke a few times. But when the royalties started coming in earnest for *Prince of Persia* and Mechner became wealthy, he wrote about how difficult it was to spend, how much he wanted to keep it.

I wish the book had been structured or edited a little differently. The journals start out with Mechner already having bunch of industry relationships and a fairly established reputation – he already published one successful game, *Karateka*. I wish this book would have started with this and Mechner's earlier unpublished games (that's [a separate book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1480297232/?coliid=ISMT7TXCBZM29&colid=W25LBJUTGFAB&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it)). And the last third of the book covers the years after *Prince of Persia*'s release – important to the story of *Prince of Persia* I guess, but not nearly as engaging as the actual making of the game. By his own admission, Mechner spent those two years goofing off.

I read the Stripe Press edition of *The Making of Prince of Persia*, which is delightfully well-made – thoughtful page layouts and excellent printing and binding.
