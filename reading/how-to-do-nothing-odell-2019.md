I liked this book a lot. Though the subtitle is "Resisting the Attention Economy," *How to Do Nothing* isn't really about why technology is bad.

"Unless we are vigilant, the current design of much of our technology will block us every step of the way, deliberately creating false targets for self-reflection, curiosity, and a desire to belong to a community."
